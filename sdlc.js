const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "Second step, determines user expectations for new project"
const design = "Third step, is how to set up a users requirements into a form"
const implementation = "Fourth step, make sure to requirements are met and what user is looking for"
const testAndIntegration = "Fith step, run code and fix any bugs"
const maintain = "Final step, fix any bugs and modifly code frequently"
